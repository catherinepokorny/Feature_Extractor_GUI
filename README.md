# Feature_Extractor_GUI
This is a custom GUI that I created that can be run outside of ArcGIS Pro. The application allows the user to extract certain types of shops (point data) located within any Central American country.

You can run the application with the custom GUI from main.py. Core_functions.py is a module that is called by the main script. I put several of the functions that are 
completely independent of the GUI into core_functions.py to foster reusability of the GUI independent code. I also included a shapefile of Central American countries 
to be used as the countries input shapefile and a OSM points shapefile to be used as the input point shapefile.

Let me know if you have any issues running it :)
